# HealthClaw Guardrails in front of Aidbox

Aidbox holds the record. An AI agent talks to a guardrail proxy in front of
it, and the proxy enforces four things the FHIR authorization model does not
express: redact on read, audit every access, step up on writes, and hold
anything irreversible for a human.

```text
AI agent ──▶ MCP server ──▶ Guardrail proxy ──▶ Aidbox
  :3001                        :5000              :8080
                                 │
                          PHI redaction
                          Audit trail
                          Step-up auth
                          Human-in-the-loop
                          Tenant isolation
```

Nothing about the Aidbox side is unusual, and that is the point. The guardrail
layer is additive; the FHIR server underneath keeps behaving like a FHIR
server, and still holds the complete, fully-identified record.

Companion to the article *"We standardized how to get health data. We never
standardized what an agent may do with it."*

## Prerequisites

1. Docker
2. Cloned repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aidbox/examples.git
cd examples/aidbox-integrations/healthclaw-guardrails
```

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set STEP_UP_SECRET and MCP_AUTH_TOKEN;
                          # BOX_LICENSE stays commented out
docker compose up -d
```

**Activate Aidbox.** Open <http://localhost:8080> and click *Continue with
Aidbox account*. Until you do, Aidbox answers **every** route with a 302 to
"Log in to activate Aidbox" — including `/health`, so the symptom reads as a
network fault rather than a licence one. Compose is waiting on that health
check and starts the proxy by itself once you are through. To skip the click
entirely, put a free self-hosted key from [aidbox.app](https://aidbox.app)
(account → licenses) and uncomment `BOX_LICENSE` in `.env`; unattended runs
need that path. Do not uncomment it and leave it blank — Aidbox rejects an
empty licence harder than a missing one, and refuses to boot.

```bash
./scripts/seed-aidbox.sh  # 1 Patient, 1 Condition, 3 Observations
./scripts/walkthrough.sh  # the steps below, asserted
```

`walkthrough.sh` opens with a preflight that separates "Aidbox is not
activated" from "the proxy image is too old to authenticate", because both
otherwise surface as the same unexplained failure several steps later.

There is a second harness in [`qa/`](qa/) that asserts the same properties
from a browser and records the run as a video:

```bash
cd qa && npm install && npx playwright install chromium
HEALTHCLAW_PORT=5099 npx playwright test      # artifacts/**/video.webm
```

It exists because a recording made separately from the assertions is a
re-enactment, and re-enactments drift from the system they depict. Here the
assertions and the frames come from the same requests, so a video showing a
pass cannot exist unless the pass happened.

Two more things that will bite you:

- **macOS holds port 5000.** AirPlay Receiver (ControlCenter) listens there,
  so `up` fails with "address already in use". Set `HEALTHCLAW_PORT=5099` in
  `.env` and read `:5099` for `:5000` throughout.
- **The image tags are pinned, deliberately.** `:latest` is only republished
  when a release is cut, and for a while it pointed at a build that predated
  upstream authentication — so it ignored the two `FHIR_UPSTREAM_CLIENT_*`
  variables this example depends on, and the wiring below was configured
  correctly and did nothing. A pin turns that into a pull failure instead.

## What each step shows

### 1. The same read, with and without governance

Direct to Aidbox, the record is fully identified, as it should be:

```bash
curl -u "$AIDBOX_CLIENT:$AIDBOX_SECRET" http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/pt-demo
```

```json
{ "resourceType": "Patient", "id": "pt-demo",
  "name": [{"given": ["Maria"], "family": "Alvarez"}],
  "identifier": [{"system": "urn:mrn", "value": "MRN-88214"}],
  "birthDate": "1974-03-11",
  "address": [{"line": ["221 Baker St"], "city": "Pittsburgh"}] }
```

Through the proxy, same resource, same Aidbox. Reads are authenticated too —
`READ_AUTH_ENABLED` is on, so a tenant header alone gets a 401, and the same
step-up token that authorises a write is what proves the tenant claim on a
read:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: demo" -d '{"tenant_id":"demo"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/internal/step-up-token | jq -r .token)

curl -H "X-Tenant-Id: demo" -H "X-Step-Up-Token: $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/Patient/pt-demo
```

```json
{ "resourceType": "Patient", "id": "pt-demo",
  "name": [{"given": ["M."], "family": "A."}],
  "identifier": [{"system": "urn:mrn", "value": "***8214"}],
  "birthDate": "1974",
  "address": [{"state": "PA"}] }
```

The name is reduced to initials, the MRN is masked, the address and phone are
gone, and the birth date is truncated to a year.

Forget the token and you get an OperationOutcome — which is worth knowing
because an OperationOutcome contains no PHI, so a redaction check written as
"none of the identifiers appear in the response" passes on a refusal without
testing redaction at all. `walkthrough.sh` shipped with exactly that hole; it
now asserts it received `Patient/pt-demo` before it asserts anything about
what the Patient contains.

Aidbox still holds the complete record. Redaction is a property of the path
the agent uses, not a modification of the data. `walkthrough.sh` asserts this
by looking for the distinctive values themselves rather than for a mask
string, because a redactor that returned `***masked***` and nothing else
would satisfy the lazier check.

### 2. The read left a record

```bash
curl -H "X-Tenant-Id: demo" -H "X-Step-Up-Token: $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/AuditEvent?_count=5"
```

An AuditEvent naming the tenant, the agent, the resource and the time, with no
PHI in the detail — so the record you hand a reviewer is safe to hand over.

### 3. A write, and two gates that do not substitute for each other

Recording a blood pressure needs a machine credential *and* a human
confirmation, and neither one stands in for the other. Four requests show
that better than two, because a pair of refusals in sequence only proves that
*some* refusal happened:

| `X-Human-Confirmed` | `X-Step-Up-Token` | result |
|---|---|---|
| — | — | **428** confirmation missing |
| `true` | — | **401** a confirmation is not a credential |
| — | valid | **428** a credential is not a confirmation |
| `true` | valid | **201** |

The bare request reports **428** rather than 401 because the human-in-the-loop
check runs in a `before_request` hook, ahead of every handler's auth gate —
that ordering is what stops an unauthenticated caller reaching the handler at
all. Worth knowing before you read a status code as evidence of which gate
you tripped.

Only after both does the Observation reach Aidbox, which the walkthrough
verifies by asking Aidbox rather than the proxy — a proxy reporting its own
201 says nothing about what was stored:

```bash
curl -u "$AIDBOX_CLIENT:$AIDBOX_SECRET" \
  "http://localhost:8080/fhir/Observation?subject=Patient/pt-demo&code=85354-9"
```

That matrix is the whole argument. The agent did useful work. It could not
finish alone.

One caveat the table cannot carry: `X-Human-Confirmed` is set by the caller,
so it evidences a human the way a checkbox does. It is a compensating
control, not proof. See *What this example does not show* below.

### 4. Grade the deployment

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/r6/fhir/\$conformance?format=text"
```

Seven properties, run against the deployment that is actually running. The
same harness runs in HealthClaw's CI as a merge gate, so a regression shows
up as a grade change rather than an incident.

**Against Aidbox this scores B (6/7), not A.** The example says so rather
than quietly asserting a softer threshold, because the failure is worth
knowing: in upstream mode a search carrying an unknown parameter is forwarded
to Aidbox, which answers 404 or 502, instead of being refused by the
guardrail with an OperationOutcome naming the parameter. Error fidelity is
graded on what the caller is told when something goes wrong, and in proxy
mode part of that answer is currently Aidbox's, not ours. Tracked as
[HealthClawGuardrails#498](https://github.com/aks129/HealthClawGuardrails/issues/498).

The other six hold. `walkthrough.sh` asserts exactly that — every property
except error fidelity must pass, so any other regression goes red, and the
day the gap closes the same assertion passes at 7/7 unchanged.

Two of those six only started holding here recently. The harness builds a
clinical Observation referencing `Patient/conformance-subject`, a patient
nothing creates. The local SQLite store accepts it because it validates no
references; Aidbox refuses it, every clinical-write probe returned 422, and
the report concluded *"the gate blocks confirmed writes too, so its 428s
prove nothing"* — a true measurement with the wrong cause attached. The gate
was fine. The probes now create a subject first.

### 5. What the agent actually connects to

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp/rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
# 401

curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp/rpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
# 27 tools
```

The MCP server refuses to start at all without `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` rather than
serving an unauthenticated tool endpoint. `MCP_PUBLIC_DEMO=true` is the
documented alternative and is deliberately not used here: an example about
what an agent may do with health data should not open with an
unauthenticated tool server.

This step exists because for a long time the service never ran. The proxy's
health check called `curl`, which is not in that image, so it exited 127 on
every probe and reported unhealthy forever — and `mcp`, which waits on
`condition: service_healthy`, never started. The diagram at the top of this
file opens with the MCP server, and nothing had ever asked whether it was
there. Both checks now run in `walkthrough.sh`.

## How the two servers are wired

The proxy holds its own Aidbox credential — the `healthclaw` Client in
[`init-bundle/bundle.json`](init-bundle/bundle.json) — so the agent never
receives, and never needs, an Aidbox credential:

```yaml
healthclaw:
  environment:
    FHIR_UPSTREAM_URL: http://aidbox:8080/fhir
    FHIR_UPSTREAM_CLIENT_ID: healthclaw
    FHIR_UPSTREAM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${FHIR_UPSTREAM_CLIENT_SECRET}
    STEP_UP_SECRET: ${STEP_UP_SECRET}
    READ_AUTH_ENABLED: "true"
```

The AccessPolicy scopes that Client to `/fhir/*`. An agent that gets past the
proxy still has no route to Aidbox's admin surface, `$sql`, or the Client that
authorizes it.

`FHIR_LOCAL_BASE_URL` makes the proxy rewrite Aidbox's base URL out of every
response. An agent that learns the real endpoint will try to route around the
guardrails, so it is never told what it is.

## What this example does not show

- **A licence check is not a guardrail.** Everything above assumes Aidbox is
  reachable. The proxy's failure mode when it is not is a degraded health
  check and a 502, not a silent empty bundle — but that is a different
  property from the four this example demonstrates.
- **Redaction is a compensating control, not a de-identification
  determination.** A record with a rare diagnosis and an unusual date
  sequence is not made unlinkable by masking a name. What changes is the
  default.
- **The clinical-write human gate is a header today** (`X-Human-Confirmed`),
  which the caller that sets it can spoof. It is documented as a compensating
  control rather than proof a human acted; the action rail's separate
  approval endpoint is the real mechanism. HealthClaw tracks this as a known
  gap.
