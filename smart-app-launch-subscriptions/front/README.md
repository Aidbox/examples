# smart-app-launch-subscriptions web app

This application is built as a JavaScript widget, so you need to build it before embedding it into a third-party project.

## Local build

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

The built files will be stored in the `dist` folder. You can then include them in your project as needed.
