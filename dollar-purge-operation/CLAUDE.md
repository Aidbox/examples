## Memories

- In this example, we implement $purge FHIR operation in TypeScript. This is all we know about $purge FHIR operation: @https://build.fhir.org/patient-operation-purge.html
- We will use aidbox (starts with docker-compose.yaml) and write a init bundle @https://docs.aidbox.app/configuration/init-bundle, which will create a new endpoint using App resource @https://docs.aidbox.app/app-development/aidbox-sdk/apps
- Example of using TypeScript app: @../aws-s3-aidbox-integration. It has good readme, also. 
- We do not need frontend here, just backend $purge operation.
